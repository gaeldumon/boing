# Boing!

### This is the game I made for my first game jam ever :)

In Boing! you are stuck in a world where the ground is making you bounce.
Shoot stones with your slingshot and hit the stars to transform the water in ice and get out of this nightmare. Careful you only have 3 stones.

Control: SPACE to shoot.

I made this with Löve2D game engine.
I really enjoyed making it, everything is made from scratch (except the game engine ofc, as it is provided by Löve2D).
